version x.y.z
	x = Major, fundamental changes, possibly breaking backwards compatability. Will probably never do a 2.0 unless WP makes some fundamental change to custom post types or google releases v4 of the api
	y = New features or other significant changes. Things that average users would want enough to upgrade.
	z = Bug fixes, minor tweaks, small feature additions

	

1.7.1	
	internatinoalization
		do functions.js? maybe in later release
		need to escape translated strings?
		
		make translations
			use marcel bootsman's code to start dutch one. see email on 9/19/2011. 
				add to other notes list w/ credit to him
				email him to let him know you used his stuff, mention he can send in new po/mo files if he improves it
				add to changelog
			
		automate it - http://www.technomancy.org/language/apertium-auto-translate-gettext/ ?
			also http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2679/
			
			blog about it if it works
			chinese
			french
			german
			japanese
			russian
			spanish
			
			later
				arabic
				czech
				danish
				dutch
				hebrew
				hindi
				irish
				italian
				korean
				malay
				polish
				portegues
				serbian
				swahili
				thai
				turkish
				ukranian
				vietnamiese
			
			
		add updated localization files to TODO list for each release. will need translators to update their files as well. start mailing list? or just do bablefish?
			also generate new pot file and update header values?
			will have to send to translators, wait for them to send back pomo files, then commit?
			cd to wordpress-i18n-tools dir
			php makepot.php wp-plugin ../wp/wp-content/plugins/basic-google-maps-placemarks/
			cp basic-google-maps-placemarks.pot ../wp/wp-content/plugins/basic-google-maps-placemarks/languages/

			
1.7.2
	bgmpdata can be output inside shortcode funciton
		this would simplify things a lot, wouldn't have to parse out anymore
		wouldn't have to use filters to insert args with do_shortcode - updatge readme
		still peek ahead to tell if shortcode called or not, and enqueue functions.js based on that, but don't need to do that for data
	
	add credits section to other notes
		list people who've contributed code, helped out in forums, translators in future
		Ridgididgi - help on forums, link to profile?
		guy who contributed code - check changelog
		
	change to mpango contact form instead of iandunn for customizations?
		or just remove it entirely? they're all small jobs.
		
	use "@deprecated" instead of just "deprecated" or @todo
	
	
		
	
1.7.3
	inline documentation
		add 3.3 pointers for intro to main things the first time they install
		add inline docu for reference - http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/help-and-screen-api-changes-in-3-3/
	
	parse shortcodes inside the info window. (would have to parse it before passed to js)
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-including-shortcodes-in-info-box?replies=1#post-2522736
		in getPlacemarks(), just pass $pp->post_content through do_shortcode() ?	
			
	cleanup, refactor stuff?	
		lots of TODOs in code
		
	if( !get_option( self::PREFIX . 'map-width' ) ), etc should be necessary in singleActivate(). add_option() already checks if it exists
		remove and test
		
	add placemark default icon by category example to readme
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-categories-feature-requests?replies=16#post-2562891
		test it out first
		
	add other notes section to readme?
		filters
		TODO list and/or feature requests
		locatlizations?
		some faqs that don't belong there?
			leave faqs for troubleshooting-ish things, "other notes" for the rest?
			make note in faqs to see "other notes" and visa-versa
		basic/advanced usage moved from installation to other notes?
		
1.7.4
	show map on single placemark page that only shows that individual marker
		add "placemarks" param to bgmp-map shortcode. e.g., [bgmp-map placemarks="13,93,234"]. pass in post ids
		add to list shortcode also?
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-placemark-page-with-just-one-placemarks
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-possibility-to-show-a-single-placemark?replies=1#post-2554004
	
	move variable init from __construct() to init hook callback. nothing but action registrations in constuct()
		same for settings class
		
	savecustomfields() should use $postid that was passed in instead of global $post->id ?
	
	ensure filtered varaable data types don't change, like you did for ODCG
		return is_array( $postMeta ) ? $postMeta : array();
	
	add notes on automatic upgrading to installation page
	
	ditch the conditional javascript loading so map arguments and do_shortcode can function like normal?
		give user option to turn off scripts except for a whitelisted list of pages or something?
		
	refactor bgmp/settings classes?
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8688738/wordpress-plugin-how-do-i-avoid-tight-coupling
		but bgmp needs to be defined before settings? maybe pass bgmp to settings rather than other way around, like it's doing now
		or just make static accessor/gettor functions in bgmp class?
	
1.minor
	infowinder not rounded anymore?
		b/c of image styles? try turning off stylesheet and see what happens
		no, b/c google changed it -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6570490/modern-rectangular-infowindow-on-maps-google-com
		can use infobubble, but that's a bunch of overhead for something small?
	
	close infobox when click anywhere outside infobox
		$(map).click( function()
		{
			if( not inside current placemark box)
				close current placemark;
		} );

	add column on View page for category, address, icon
		
		
		
		
2.0
	rewrite as MVC and better OO?
		break core.php up into smaller files for each class
			core, geocode, etc
		all the models should be unit-testable
		controllers should be?
		http://wordpress.tv/2010/04/24/blair-williams-wordpress-plugins-oc10/
		look at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-mvc/, http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tina-mvc/, Churro: @ wordpress.org extend /plugins /churro [not to use, just to get ideas]
		http://www.jessehanson.com/2011/01/02/mvc-based-wordpress-plugins/
		do other research
		
2.0.minor
	finish setting up unit testing
		add to 'before each new release' list
			add new unit tests for any new/modified code
			run unit tests
		php - simpletest plugin?
			maybe need to refactor everything so methods are more testable. break into controller and model. models should take input, do shit, and return. that's testable. the two mixed together isn't testable.
			add unit tests for all functions
			add integration tests for all functions (in separate file)
		js
			fireunit? kinda old, but most of the newer ones seem to require eclipse or something else
			http://www.slideshare.net/aaronjorbin/dont-repeat-your-mistakes-javascript-unit-testing
				look for wordpress.tv video of it from wrdcamp sf 2011
		
		maybe make this 2.0 if you need to rewrite everything to be more MVC and testable. probably not worth the effort, unless you just want to do it to learn
			could abstract out the hooks, api interaction etc in the constructors, and have the models all accept/return variables so they'd be testable. supposed to test controllers instead of models, though?

	
1.major.x
	change localize_script() to wp_add_script_data when that's added 
		may not need to manually json_encode() once you do this. it might do it for you
		wp 3.3 localize_script supports arrays now, so don't need separate map and marker variables in js? can just output a single bgmpdata array?
	
	switch to wp_add_script_before if it comes out in wp 3.4. wait until 3.5 is out, though, to give people time to upgrade.
	
1.major.x
	switch to using add_meta_boxes_{$page} hook
		http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2011/12/07/do-not-include-wp-adminincludestemplate-php-to-get-add_meta_box/

1.major.x
	
	add current_user_can() in places -- http://wordpress.tv/2011/09/07/mark-jaquith-jon-cave-brad-williams-plugin-security-showdown/ 11:30
	
	map covers dropdowns bug
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/google-map-covering-dropdown-menus?replies=2#post-2300994

	can't call enqueueMessage() in settings.php - http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-that-address-couldnt-be-geocoded-fatal-error?replies=5
		fixed w/ temp workaround, but need better solution
		just make enqueuemssage public?
	
	
1.major.x
	run tests on memory consumption, etc. see if you can find any areas of code that would significantly benefit from optimization
		ask for advice on wordpress answers for tips on how to test
	
	wahc doesn't work as demo anymore since not current version. setup wpms playground blog as new demo, populate w/ sample content. update link in readme. make sure to update w/ new releases (add to list above). don't use to test, only as pristine demo.

	redo enqueuemessage,etc to use WP_Error objects instead of just strings?
		but what about for normal messages?

	look for all @todo comments in code, and move them here. clean them up before moving on to next 1.major version

	update readme filter examples w/ http://wpengineer.com/2319/advent-calendar-predefined-callback-functions-for-filters/
			

1.major.minor
	add icon next to name in list shortcode
	add option to disable info windows
	lant/long shouldn't be disabled input fields, should just be regular text. some people will think they should be able to edit it.

1.major
	add hooks/filters
		filters done in core, but not documented. need to escape?
		document their usage in readme.
		do this instead of options? in addition to?
		don't forget settings.php, views, etc. probably shouldn't be any in views, only in models/controllers
	try to detect if theme is loading google maps api, and then don't do it?
		e.g., http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-broken-map-with-dk-template?replies=1#post-2522633
		
1.major.minor
	enqueuemessage() bug - adds it twice for coordinates error, probably for everything else too
	do shortcode bit only works with 'front page setting', not straight home.php template
		Home.php would have to setup a custom $post variable with query_posts() or WP_Query() in order to access the content, but there's no way to pass that version of $post to the shortcode check function.
		maybe add a second array where you can defined template file names (e.g., home.php, map.php, etc) instead-of/in-addition-to post slugs
			http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/10537/get-name-of-the-current-template-file
		maybe make a static function they can call that will just pass a single array w/ slugs? instead of them having to setup shit in the theme's functions.php?
		is_home() helpful?
		update faq
	maybe look at encoding the content w/ some reversible algorithm so that email addresses aren't exposed in $bgmpData
		would have to add an option to turn on/off?
	wp 3.3 could affect js handling
		http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11520
	maybe break messages and describe into Toolbelt class
		give it it's own name not related to bgmp, a version number toos

		
1.major.minor
	http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=1724 workaround
		didn't work. file a new bug report for the issue. setup a test page
		when fixed, remove the override styles.
	errors shouldn't overwrite the map unless the map can't be loaded anyway
		map may load fine, but then error with placemarks. don't want to kill map just b/c placemark didn't load.
		log to console instead
			only if a ?bgmp_debug parameter is passed in, so you don't clutter the console 
		also add error to page. create a new empty <p> under map for messages
		create a bgmp.log() that's a wrapper for if(window.console) console.log
	width px and % -- http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-how-to-tweak-the-code-to-get-width-instead-of-fixed-px?replies=4#post-2242249
		test to make sure it can work as he described across browsers. if so, probalby just leave as is and update docs to let people know
	describe()
		add 'transient' as option
			set_transient( self::PREFIX .'consturct', 'blah', 60 );
		add 'echo' behavior, and return another option
			already copy/pasted, but need to test
		make it a switch instead of if else ifelse
		
1.major.minor
	loadresources isn't specifiying a version number for the maps api. if they switch to v4 i don't want to plugin to automatically do it
		see if you can specify v3
	enqueuemessage should let it can be converted to string
		if it has a __toString() function
			does that cover types like int, or have to list them manually?
			http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#language.oop5.magic.tostring
		maybe hve it enqueue an error instead of returning false, since not really gonna check if it returns true
	test to make sure wp action actually is working for essages. i don't think it runs on edit-page, so wouldn't get notice of geocode error
		check out wp_enqueue_scripts
		if works, update wpse question. also add it and admin_enqueue_scripts to codex list in the appropriate order
	
1.major.minor
	double check that everything is sanitized
	give everything a once over, check comments, empty phpdoc lines, etc
	stat bug is back - http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/21132/repository-reporting-incorrect-plugin-active-version-stat
		http://phpdoc.wordpress.org/trunk/WordPress/Administration/_wp-admin---includes---plugin.php.html#functionget_plugin_data
	admin_notices
		target
			http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14696
			have to go through each message and deterine who it should go to
			this will bump required version up to 3.1
				reember to update readme and environment check
			might want to use is_user_admin() when setting or displaying
		error in addFeaturedImageSupport being added multiple times
			maybe b/c sitting on page and auto-save adds one?
			could not call enqueue if auto-save inside addFeaturedImageSupport, but probably better to check if message already enqueues inside enqueueMessage()
			might be fixed by 'target' task, but probably not
	add option to disable the 'image media button disabled' warning. would have to be site-wide option?
		update error message to let them know they can disable it
	organize FAQ page into sections?
	
	
1.major.minor
	add px units to $('#bgmp_map-canvas').css('width', response.width ); etc ?
		probably, just need to test
		check the rest of the file for other places
	better method of setting style defaults than the current one? want to let users easily override widht/height w/ their css or code
		maybe just add filter before sending to json, but that still doesn't feel right
	add support forum link to plugin page
	uninstall script
		take wpms into account
		uninstall settings but not data. note that on the installation page under an 'uninstall' section
		removed the infowindow height and renamed the infowindow width (to maxwidth) option in v1.2.1 or 1.3. remember that you still need to remove from db here

1.major
	remove the 'upgrade to 1.0 addresses' activation bit - no longer needed for most users
	mobile support
	mobile placemark bug
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-i-cant-see-the-placemark-on-my-mobile-phone?replies=1#post-2201681
		read through code, try to think of what may cause it
		try googling for answer	
		
1.major.minor
	look into http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring to see if you should do things that way
		
	
1.major.major
	some things may only need to run on the admin side, or only on the front end. check for that and handle appropriatly
		keep in mind http:codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins note 3 about being inside is_admin()
	custom icon for placemarks menu. maybe a pinpoint? (similar to default google maps icon, but not exact same b/c of copyright)
	
	

	
	
user requests. implement if enough people ask
	6 - javascript to toggle categories on map dynamically
	5 - have links in [bgmp-list] open repsective info on map. 
		would also be nice if arbitary links could do the same (e.g., links generated by the user, not bgmp)
		would have to have a settings to flag whether or not it's active, so that the list could still be independent of the map

		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-categories-feature-requests?replies=13#post-2558220
	3 - instead of setting icon on placemark, you could set it on taxonomy. looks for in order: placemark icon > category icon > default icon
	2 - set width as % in addition to px
			check that google api allows that
			this may be working in 1.3 already, check notes for 1.3.2 or 1.3.3 for testing info
	2 - directions (and other options that google includes in their implementaiton? e.g., 'zoom here'?
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-directions?replies=2#post-2494522
		one other?
	2 - option to have placemark info window open when map loads.
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-placemark-show-by-default?replies=3#post-2519181
	
		at least 1 other?
	1 - separate role for placemarks, so users can add placemarks but not regular posts
	1 - user supplied text for map link on list shortcode
		filter exists already, but not easy to use
	1 - option to disable info windows
	1 - zip code search to display placemarks near a given zip code. could also have a shortcode option to display them
	1 - search only placemarks
	1 - shortcode argument for post id, then only display that post on the map
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-possibility-to-show-a-single-placemark?replies=1
	1 - geolocate ip and use as addr for placemark
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-automatic-location?replies=1#post-2566677
	
future/maybe
	list shortcode sorting
		order by alphabetical - this already posible b/c of filter?
		order posts by latitude, zip code or something meaningful. distance from map center?
			api does return city/county/etc data
		option to choose which method used (most recent, alphabetical, distance/location)
	map won't load if theme doesn't call wp_footer(). add check to make sure theme is doing that. display error if it isn't.
	look into having a capability so users can control what other users can add them?
	add ? icon next to address field and move the 'you can type in blah blah' bit there
