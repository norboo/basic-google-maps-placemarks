1.1.4
	test against 3.2, update readme
	make sure works in multisite. 
		setup new wpms install at playground to test
		add answer to faq
	double check that everything is sanitized
	give everything a once over, check comments, empty phpdoc lines, etc

1.1.5
	uninstall script
		uninstall settings but not data. note that on the installation page under an 'uninstall' section
	add error to long/lat fields (or somewhere) when geocode doesn't result correct coordinates
	
1.2
	add hooks/filters
		document their usage in readme.
	internatinoalization
		use bablefish to make crappy translations for common languages. 
		add list of transatlions to readme
			say 'contact me' to help out w/ translation	
	create own settings page, instead of on writing.

1.3
	add column on View page for address, icon

	add ? icon next to address field and move the 'you can type in blah blah' bit there
	
1.4
	realized too late that it didn't need ajax at all. oh well, at least it was good learning experience. take it out to improve loading speed and just reference older versions when needed
	

future
	some things may only need to run on the admin side, or only on the front end. check for that and handle appropriatly
		keep in mind http:codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins note 3 about being inside is_admin()
	custom icon for placemarks menu. maybe a pinpoint? (similar to default google maps icon, but not exact same b/c of copyright)
	some kind of internal help screen to let people know about the shortcodes, etc?
		probably just use the readme?
	log to console by default, so you can easily troubleshoot other websites? or maybe only if a ?bgmp_debug parameter is passed in, so you don't clutter the console 
	map won't load if theme doesn't call wp_footer(). add check to make sure theme is doing that. display error if it isn't.
	look into having a capability so users can control what other users can add them?
	
	if enough people ask
		add ability to create multiple maps w/ distinct sets of markers, but only if more people ask for it
			would create a post type for maps, then have a field on markers which define which map it's associated w/
		define z-index for each marker
