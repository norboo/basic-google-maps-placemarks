1.1.2
	create own settings page, instead of on writing. its own page eventually, just don't want to deal w/ it right now
		check cimcool 1.1 plugins
	make sure works in multisite
	uninstall script
		uninstall settings but not data. note that on the installation page under an 'uninstall' section
	give everything a once over, check comments, empty phpdoc lines, etc
	double check that everything is sanitized
	
1.1.3 or 1.2
	add option to select map type, disable type selector for user, select zoom control -- http:www.svennerberg.com/examples/google_maps_3/properties.php
	add column on View page for address, icon
	try to get info windows to be auto height relative to content inside
	close infobox when click anywhere outside infobox
	in list shortcode, order posts by latitude, zip code or something meaningful. api does return city/county/etc data
	
future
	maybe reorder functions to make more sense
	some things may only need to run on the admin side, or only on the front end. check for that and handle appropriatly
		keep in mind http:codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins note 3 about being inside is_admin()
	just realized maps didn't need ajax at all. too late to change now. oh well, at least it's good learning experience
	add settings functions into their own file?
	add hooks and document their usage in readme. (do this for other plugins too)
	custom icon for placemarks menu. maybe a pinpoint? (similar to default google maps icon, but not exact same b/c of copyright)
	some kind of internal help screen to let people know about the shortcodes, etc?
		probably just use the readme?
	log to console by default, so you can easily troubleshoot other websites? or maybe only if a ?bgmp_debug parameter is passed in, so you don't clutter the console 
	break address field up into street/city/state/zip on the add/edit form? no, don't really want to. why?
	map won't load if theme doesn't call wp_footer(). add check to make sure theme is doing that. display error if it isn't.
	look into having a capability so users can control what other users can add them?
