// 1.1
	// if no featured image set, use google's default marker
	// uninstall script
	// ask for address and geocode it
	// give everything a once over, check comments, etc
	// double check that everything is sanitized
	// if ( !current_user_can( 'edit_post', $post_id ) ) return;. where to, though?
	// maybe have an admin option to choose whether to set width/height inline or in stylehseet. if inline, then have width/height options. probably do this eventually for userfriendlyness

// future
	// close infobox when click anywhere outside infobox
	// maybe reorder functions to make more sense
	// some things may only need to run on the admin side, or only on the front end. check for that and handle appropriatly
		// keep in mind http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins note 3 about being inside is_admin()
	// just realized maps didn't need ajax at all. too late to change now. oh well, at least it's good learning experience
	// add column on View page for lat/long, whether or not it has icon set?
	// add option to select map type, disable type selector for user, select zoom control -- http://www.svennerberg.com/examples/google_maps_3/properties.php
	// clean these up, put into @todo somewhere. either at top, or inline in functions. maybe one or the other depending on type of comment
	// try to get info windows to be auto height relative to content inside
	// add settings functions into their own file?
	// maybe put views in their own folder
	// make default options process more intuitive. if they don't set options, they get error that they're not set, but then they go there and they look like they're filled in even though they're not in db. 
		// maybe save default options in db upon install instead. would have to make sure nothing there already
	// add hooks and document their usage in readme. (do this for other plugins too)
