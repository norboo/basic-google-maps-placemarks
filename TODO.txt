version x.y.z
	x = Major, fundamental changes, possibly breaking backwards compatability. Will probably never do a 2.0 unless WP makes some fundamental change to custom post types or google releases v4 of the api
	y = New features or other significant changes. Things that average users would want enough to upgrade.
	z = Bug fixes, minor tweaks, small feature additions

1.5.2
	wp 3.3 support
		change to wp_add_script_data when that's added to beta/rc - may not need to manually json_encode() once you do this. it might do it for you
	test in rcs
	update readme stable tag/tested again
	
1.5.3 - break this into 2 minor releases?
	change infowindow titles from h1 to h3
	add current_user_can() in places -- http://wordpress.tv/2011/09/07/mark-jaquith-jon-cave-brad-williams-plugin-security-showdown/ 11:30
	http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/27418/adding-labels-to-setting-titles-with-api

		http://code.google.com/p/earth-api-samples/issues/detail?id=9&colspec=ID%20
		http://maps.myosotissp.com/demos/popups.html
	maybe put this into 1.5 since already started some of the unit test stuff
	make default description color black - http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-no-description-in-placemark-balloon?replies=3#post-2376199
	let listshortcode accept taxonomy like mapshortcode does
		also, should probably use getPlacemarks() instead of it's own get_posts() call
	can't call enqueueMessage() in settings.php - http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-that-address-couldnt-be-geocoded-fatal-error?replies=5
		fixed w/ temp workaround, but need better solution
	set different center point for different maps. through shortcode args? zoom too.
	merged 2 shutdown() conditions into a single line. test.
	added esc_html() in printmessages(). will that mess up any warnings that have bold tags etc?
	line breaks messing up lists --- http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-line-breaks-added-to-description-popup?replies=1
	move 'help' link to next to 'visit pluygin site' instead of with settings/deactivate ?
	bgmp-map shortcode accepts center,zoom, etc parameters
		make a note on teh settings page about this w/ link to instructions page 
	
1.minor
	add option to select map type, disable type selector for user, select zoom control -- http:www.svennerberg.com/examples/google_maps_3/properties.php
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-change-map-type, probably a few others
	option for hybrid mode and sattelite view, zoom bar, etc
	
1.major
	finish setting up unit testing
		add to 'before each new release' list
			add new unit tests for any new/modified code
			run unit tests
		php - simpletest plugin?
			maybe need to refactor everything so methods are more testable. break into controller and model. models should take input, do shit, and return. that's testable. the two mixed together isn't testable.
			add unit tests for all functions
			add integration tests for all functions (in separate file)
		js
			fireunit? kinda old, but most of the newer ones seem to require eclipse or something else
			http://www.slideshare.net/aaronjorbin/dont-repeat-your-mistakes-javascript-unit-testing
				look for wordpress.tv video of it from wrdcamp sf 2011

1.minor
	add icon next to name in list shortcode
	add column on View page for address, icon
	close infobox when click anywhere outside infobox
		$(map).click( function()
		{
			if( not inside current placemark box)
				close current placemark;
		} );
	add option to disable info windows
	lant/long shouldn't be disabled input fields, should just be regular text. some people will think they should be able to edit it.

1.major
	add hooks/filters
		document their usage in readme.
		do this instead of options? in addition to?
	
1.major
	internatinoalization
		use marcel bootsman's code to start dutch one. see email on 9/19/2011
		use bablefish to make crappy translations for common languages. 
		add list of transatlions to readme
			say 'contact me' to help out w/ translation	
		when this is done, maybe take some things out of faq and make a 'features' list on main page
			wpms support
			i8n
			blah blah	
	
1.minor
	enqueuemessage() bug - adds it twice for coordinates error, probably for everything else too
	do shortcode bit only works with 'front page setting', not straight home.php template
		Home.php would have to setup a custom $post variable with query_posts() or WP_Query() in order to access the content, but there's no way to pass that version of $post to the shortcode check function.
		maybe add a second array where you can defined template file names (e.g., home.php, map.php, etc) instead-of/in-addition-to post slugs
			http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/10537/get-name-of-the-current-template-file
		maybe make a static function they can call that will just pass a single array w/ slugs? instead of them having to setup shit in the theme's functions.php?
		is_home() helpful?
		update faq
	maybe look at encoding the content w/ some reversible algorithm so that email addresses aren't exposed in $bgmpData
		would have to add an option to turn on/off?
	wp 3.3 could affect js handling
		http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11520
	maybe break messages and describe into Toolbelt class
		give it it's own name not related to bgmp, a version number toos

		
1.minor
	http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=1724 workaround
		didn't work. file a new bug report for the issue. setup a test page
		when fixed, remove the override styles.
	errors shouldn't overwrite the map unless the map can't be loaded anyway
		map may load fine, but then error with placemarks. don't want to kill map just b/c placemark didn't load.
		log to console instead
			only if a ?bgmp_debug parameter is passed in, so you don't clutter the console 
		also add error to page. create a new empty <p> under map for messages
		create a bgmp.log() that's a wrapper for if(window.console) console.log
	width px and % -- http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-how-to-tweak-the-code-to-get-width-instead-of-fixed-px?replies=4#post-2242249
		test to make sure it can work as he described across browsers. if so, probalby just leave as is and update docs to let people know
	describe()
		add 'transient' as option
			set_transient( self::PREFIX .'consturct', 'blah', 60 );
		add 'echo' behavior, and return another option
			already copy/pasted, but need to test
		make it a switch instead of if else ifelse
		
1.minor
	loadresources isn't specifiying a version number for the maps api. if they switch to v4 i don't want to plugin to automatically do it
		see if you can specify v3
	enqueuemessage should let it can be converted to string
		if it has a __toString() function
			does that cover types like int, or have to list them manually?
			http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#language.oop5.magic.tostring
		maybe hve it enqueue an error instead of returning false, since not really gonna check if it returns true
	test to make sure wp action actually is working for essages. i don't think it runs on edit-page, so wouldn't get notice of geocode error
		check out wp_enqueue_scripts
		if works, update wpse question. also add it and admin_enqueue_scripts to codex list in the appropriate order
	
1.minor
	double check that everything is sanitized
	give everything a once over, check comments, empty phpdoc lines, etc
	stat bug is back - http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/21132/repository-reporting-incorrect-plugin-active-version-stat
	admin_notices
		target
			http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14696
			have to go through each message and deterine who it should go to
			this will bump required version up to 3.1
				reember to update readme and environment check
			might want to use is_user_admin() when setting or displaying
		error in addFeaturedImageSupport being added multiple times
			maybe b/c sitting on page and auto-save adds one?
			could not call enqueue if auto-save inside addFeaturedImageSupport, but probably better to check if message already enqueues inside enqueueMessage()
			might be fixed by 'target' task, but probably not
	add option to disable the 'image media button disabled' warning. would have to be site-wide option?
		update error message to let them know they can disable it
	organize FAQ page into sections?
	
	
1.minor
	add px units to $('#bgmp_map-canvas').css('width', response.width ); etc ?
		probably, just need to test
		check the rest of the file for other places
	better method of setting style defaults than the current one? want to let users easily override widht/height w/ their css or code
		maybe just add filter before sending to json, but that still doesn't feel right
	add support forum link to plugin page
	uninstall script
		take wpms into account
		uninstall settings but not data. note that on the installation page under an 'uninstall' section
		removed the infowindow height and renamed the infowindow width (to maxwidth) option in v1.2.1 or 1.3. remember that you still need to remove from db here

1.major
	remove the 'upgrade to 1.0 addresses' activation bit - no longer needed for most users
	mobile support
	mobile placemark bug
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-i-cant-see-the-placemark-on-my-mobile-phone?replies=1#post-2201681
		read through code, try to think of what may cause it
		try googling for answer	
		
1.minor
	look into http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring to see if you should do things that way
		
	
1.major
	some things may only need to run on the admin side, or only on the front end. check for that and handle appropriatly
		keep in mind http:codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins note 3 about being inside is_admin()
	custom icon for placemarks menu. maybe a pinpoint? (similar to default google maps icon, but not exact same b/c of copyright)
	
	

	
	
user requests. implement if enough people ask
	1 - set width as % in addition to px
			check that google api allows that
			this may be working in 1.3 already, check notes for 1.3.2 or 1.3.3 for testing info
	1 - option to disable zooming
	1 - separate role for placemarks, so users can add placemarks but not regular posts
	1 - user supplied text for map link on list shortcode
	1 - option to disable info windowss
	1 - custom taxonomy for placemark categories. each category would have an image. so instead of setting icon on placemark, you'd set icon on taxonomy, and then set taxonomy on placemark
	1 - directions
	
future/maybe
	list shortcode sorting
		order by alphabetical
		order posts by latitude, zip code or something meaningful. distance from map center?
			api does return city/county/etc data
		option to choose which method used (most recent, alphabetical, distance/location)
	some kind of internal help screen to let people know about the shortcodes, etc?
		probably just use the readme?
	map won't load if theme doesn't call wp_footer(). add check to make sure theme is doing that. display error if it isn't.
	look into having a capability so users can control what other users can add them?
	add version number to db option so can check it to know when to upgrade data?
		and wouldn't have to run upgrades for < that version
		clear caches after running upgrade - if(functino_exists('wp_clear_cache')...
	add ? icon next to address field and move the 'you can type in blah blah' bit there
