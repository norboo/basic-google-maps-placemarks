1.3.1
	errors shouldn't overwrite the map unless the map can't be loaded anyway
		map may load fine, but then error with placemarks. don't want to kill map just b/c placemark didn't load.
		log to console instead
			only if a ?bgmp_debug parameter is passed in, so you don't clutter the console 
		also add error to page. create a new empty <p> under map for messages
		create a bgmp.log() that's a wrapper for if(window.console) console.log
	http://wordpress.org/support/topic/placemarks-not-showing-up-in-firefox?replies=4#post-2229428 - just have to cast to string before passing to maps api or soething?
		check/cast other things everything else that's passed to the api too
	if 1.3 didn't fix 'not all passed in' bug, then check it out more.
		also, why is this looping forever?
	other support forum bugs
		
1.3.2
	test in bizco, raindrop and vanilla themes
	other open wp forums bugs
	3.2 back end screenshots on wahc (have to move to hc6l first)
	
	
minor
	double check that everything is sanitized
	give everything a once over, check comments, empty phpdoc lines, etc
	stat bug is back - http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/21132/repository-reporting-incorrect-plugin-active-version-stat
	admin_notices
		target
			http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14696
			have to go through each message and deterine who it should go to
			this will bump required version up to 3.1
				reember to update readme and environment check
			might want to use is_user_admin() when setting or displaying
		error in addFeaturedImageSupport being added multiple times
			maybe b/c sitting on page and auto-save adds one?
			could not call enqueue if auto-save inside addFeaturedImageSupport, but probably better to check if message already enqueues inside enqueueMessage()
			might be fixed by 'target' task, but probably not
	add option to disable the 'image media button disabled' warning. would have to be site-wide option?
		update error message to let them know they can disable it
	organize FAQ page into sections?
	
	
minor
	add description to zoom setting on writing page. 
		what's the allowed range? 
			add error check for that
		is the lower number more zoomed in or less?
	add px units to $('#bgmp_map-canvas').css('width', response.width ); etc ?
		probably, just need to test
		check the rest of the file for other places
	better method of setting style defaults than the current one? want to let users easily override widht/height w/ their css or code
		maybe just add filter before sending to json, but that still doesn't feel right
	add support forum link to plugin page
	uninstall script
		take wpms into account
		uninstall settings but not data. note that on the installation page under an 'uninstall' section
		removed the infowindow height and renamed the infowindow width (to maxwidth) option in v1.2.1 or 1.3. remember that you still need to remove from db here

major
	mobile support
	mobile placemark bug
		http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-i-cant-see-the-placemark-on-my-mobile-phone?replies=1#post-2201681
		read through code, try to think of what may cause it
		try googling for answer	
		
major
	look into http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring to see if you should do things that way
		

minor
	create own settings page, instead of on writing.
		check cimcool 1.1 plugins
		update the settings link on plugins page
	close infobox when click anywhere outside infobox
		$(map).click( function()
		{
			if( not inside current placemark box)
				close current placemark;
		} );
	add option to select map type, disable type selector for user, select zoom control -- http:www.svennerberg.com/examples/google_maps_3/properties.php

	
major
	some things may only need to run on the admin side, or only on the front end. check for that and handle appropriatly
		keep in mind http:codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins note 3 about being inside is_admin()
	custom icon for placemarks menu. maybe a pinpoint? (similar to default google maps icon, but not exact same b/c of copyright)
	
	
major
	add hooks/filters
		document their usage in readme.
		do this instead of options? in addition to?
	
major
	internatinoalization
		use bablefish to make crappy translations for common languages. 
		add list of transatlions to readme
			say 'contact me' to help out w/ translation	
		when this is done, maybe take some things out of faq and make a 'features' list on main page
			wpms support
			i8n
			blah blah	
	
major
	add column on View page for address, icon
	try to get info windows to be auto height relative to content inside
	list shortcode sorting
		order by alphabetical
		order posts by latitude, zip code or something meaningful. distance from map center?
			api does return city/county/etc data
		option to choose which method used (most recent, alphabetical, distance/location)
	add ? icon next to address field and move the 'you can type in blah blah' bit there

	
user requests. implement if enough people ask
	2 - add ability to create multiple maps w/ distinct sets of markers, but only if more people ask for it
		would create a post type for maps, then have a field on markers which define which map it's associated w/
	1 - define z-index for each marker
	1 - set width as % in addition to px
		check that google api allows that
	1 - option to disable zooming
	1 - separate role for placemarks, so users can add placemarks but not regular posts
	1 - list shortcode sorting
	1 - user supplied text for map link on list shortcode
	1 - option for hybrid mode and sattelite view, zoom bar, etc

	
future
	some kind of internal help screen to let people know about the shortcodes, etc?
		probably just use the readme?
	map won't load if theme doesn't call wp_footer(). add check to make sure theme is doing that. display error if it isn't.
	look into having a capability so users can control what other users can add them?
	add version number to db option so can check it to know when to upgrade data?
		and wouldn't have to run upgrades for < that version
