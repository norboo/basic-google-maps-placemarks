	uninstall script
	give everything a once over, check comments, empty phpdoc lines, etc
	double check that everything is sanitized
	if ( !current_user_can( 'edit_post', $post_id ) ) return;. where to, though?
	maybe have an admin option to choose whether to set width/height inline or in stylehseet. if inline, then have width/height options. probably do this eventually for userfriendlyness	
	
future
	create own settings page, instead of on writing. its own page eventually, just don't want to deal w/ it right now
	option to override style. wrap front-end-head.php in if( option= true ) statement
	close infobox when click anywhere outside infobox
	maybe reorder functions to make more sense
	some things may only need to run on the admin side, or only on the front end. check for that and handle appropriatly
		keep in mind http:codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins note 3 about being inside is_admin()
	just realized maps didn't need ajax at all. too late to change now. oh well, at least it's good learning experience
	add column on View page for address, icon
	add option to select map type, disable type selector for user, select zoom control -- http:www.svennerberg.com/examples/google_maps_3/properties.php
	try to get info windows to be auto height relative to content inside
	add settings functions into their own file?
	maybe put views and images in their own folder
	add hooks and document their usage in readme. (do this for other plugins too)
	custom icon for placemarks menu. maybe a pinpoint? (similar to default google maps icon, but not exact same b/c of copyright)
	some kind of internal help screen to let people know about the shortcodes, etc?
	log to console by default, so you can easily troubleshoot other websites? or maybe only if a ?bgmp_debug parameter is passed in, so you don't clutter the console 
	break address field up into street/city/state/zip on the add/edit form
	make sure works in multisite
	map won't load if theme doesn't call wp_footer(). add check to make sure theme is doing that. display error if it isn't.
	in list shortcode, order posts by latitude, zip code or something meaningful. api does return city/county/etc data
